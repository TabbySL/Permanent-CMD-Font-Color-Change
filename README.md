# Cmd font Color Changer (.reg)




The .(.reg) files given in the repo will  change the cmd font color as you need. 

We all know that when you change the color using the 'color' command through cmd, it will reset it once you restart the cmd.exe 

But through this reg file, the change will be permanent*, thus you dont have to keep changing the color manually.
of course the change is reversible if you want.)  

There are a few colors provided to change the cmd Color, but will be updated to all 16 colors supported by  CMD

 
  
  

*Permanent in the sense CAN BE reversible. No need to worry about anything... 

## Deployment

To deploy this project, all you have to do is to Click on the (.reg) file you prefer and click yes on the prompt.
